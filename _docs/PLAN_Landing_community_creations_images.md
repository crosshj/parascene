we will add a new section below the "powerful generative tools" section but before the "get involved" section

in this section:

we should give them 8 of the top creations from the site in a responsive grid
top="most liked" with "most comments" breaking the tie

each of the items from this grid should have overlayed at the bottom left:
creator icon _ empty heart icon with number of likes next to it _ comments icon with number of comments

above the grid:
centered title: "Explore AI Generated Art"
muted description centered: "
Join millions of other AI Art enthusiasts and explore, like and comment on the top AI generated images and AI styles."
(please change all wording for title and description)


below the grid:
two buttons in a row that is centerd
1) primary button that matches other primary buttons on this page, read "Join Now" - goes to auth signup page
2) outlined button that says "Explore More" - goes to a special page that lets unauth'ed users explore a grid of images from the community similar to the grid above but with infinite scroll and auto load
