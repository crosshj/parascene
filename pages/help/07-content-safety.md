## NSFW content is off by default

Content that creators mark as **Not Suitable for Work (NSFW)** is **hidden by default**. You’ll see a blurred overlay and an “NSFW” label instead of the image. This keeps the feed and explore experience safe by default.

## Where the NSFW toggles are

The two NSFW controls live in the **Profile modal**:

1. **Open the Profile modal** — Click your **avatar** (or **Profile**) in the top navigation or mobile bottom bar.
2. In the modal, below your email and member info, you’ll see two checkboxes (the second one only appears after you turn on the first).

## What the two toggles do

**Enable NSFW Content** (first checkbox)

- **Off (default)** — NSFW does not show up anywhere in the app.
- **On** — You allow NSFW content and it shows up in the app.

**Show NSFW Unobscured** (second checkbox; only visible when “Enable NSFW Content” is on)

- **Off** — NSFW images stay **blurred** even though you’ve allowed them. You can still open creation pages and, if you want, click the blur once to reveal for that session.
- **On** — NSFW images are shown **without blur** everywhere (feed, explore, creation detail, profile grids).

Both settings are saved immediately and apply across the app. You can change them anytime by opening the Profile modal again.

## How to interact with NSFW in the app

- **Feed and Explore** — Clicking an NSFW card (blurred or not) takes you to the **creation detail** page. No extra confirmation.
- **Creation detail** — On the creation page, if the image is still blurred and you haven’t enabled viewing, you can click the overlay to confirm once and reveal it for that session, or turn on **Show NSFW Unobscured** in the Profile modal for a permanent setting.
- **Your Creations** — When [publishing](/help/connect/share-your-creations) or editing a creation, you can check **Not Suitable for Work (NSFW)** so it’s blurred for others by default.

## Summary

- NSFW viewing is **disabled by default** (blurred).
- Open the **Profile modal** (avatar or Profile) to use **Enable NSFW Content** and **Show NSFW Unobscured**; the second only appears when the first is on.
- Clicking NSFW cards in feed or explore **goes straight to the creation detail** page.
- Creators mark creations as NSFW when publishing so viewers get the blurred experience unless they’ve enabled viewing.
