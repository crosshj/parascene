## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Notice describes how parascene ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our website, app, and related services (the "Service"). We are committed to being transparent about our data practices. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described here.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information you provide and information we get from your use of the Service.

### Information you provide

- **Account data:** email, password (stored in hashed form), username, display name, profile details (e.g., avatar, bio), and preferences you set.
- **Content:** creations (e.g., prompts, images, titles, descriptions), comments, likes, and other content you post or submit.
- **Communications:** messages you send to us (e.g., support, feedback, feature requests) and any contact details you include.
- **Payment-related data:** if you purchase credits, tip, or use other paid features, we or our payment processors receive transaction information as needed to process payments and comply with law. We do not store full payment card numbers.

### Information we collect automatically

- **Usage data:** how you use the Service (e.g., pages or features used, actions taken, time spent), device type, browser, and general location (e.g., country or region) where we can infer it.
- **Log data:** IP address, request timestamps, and similar technical logs that our servers record for operation and security.
- **Cookies and similar tech:** we use cookies and similar technologies for session management, preferences, security, and analytics as described below.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Service (e.g., hosting your content, powering feeds, credits, and notifications).
- Authenticate you and manage your account and preferences.
- Process payments and enforce our terms and policies.
- Send you service-related messages (e.g., password reset, important product updates) and, with your consent where required, marketing or product news.
- Understand usage and improve the product (e.g., analytics, debugging, research).
- Protect the Service and users (e.g., fraud prevention, abuse detection, security).
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to valid legal process.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in these cases:

- **With your consent or at your direction:** e.g., when you choose to connect a third-party server or share content publicly.
- **Service providers:** we use vendors for hosting, analytics, email, payments, and similar functions. They may access data only as needed to perform those services and under contract.
- **Third-party servers and providers:** if you use connected servers or providers (e.g., for generation), they may receive data you send through the Service in line with their own privacy policies.
- **Legal and safety:** we may disclose information if required by law, to protect our or others' rights and safety, or in connection with a merger, sale, or other change of control (with notice where required).

## 5. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., local storage) for:

- **Essential operation:** session and authentication, security, and load balancing.
- **Preferences:** remembering settings (e.g., theme, language) so we can honor your choices.
- **Analytics and performance:** understanding how the Service is used so we can improve it; we may use first-party or third-party analytics in a way that respects your privacy.

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may limit some features of the Service.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service, enforce our terms, and comply with law. After you delete your account or request deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, except where we must retain it for legal, security, or operational reasons (e.g., backups, dispute resolution).

## 7. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. No system is completely secure; you are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for the security of your device and network.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:

- **Access and portability:** request a copy of the personal data we hold about you or receive it in a portable format.
- **Correction:** ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data (you can also update many details in your account settings).
- **Deletion:** request deletion of your personal data, subject to exceptions under applicable law.
- **Restriction or objection:** in some jurisdictions, restrict or object to certain processing of your data.
- **Withdraw consent:** where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time (e.g., unsubscribing from marketing emails).

To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in the Contact section. We will respond in line with applicable law. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country.

## 9. Children

The Service is not directed at children under 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 10. International Transfers

We may store and process data in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate. If you are outside those countries, your data may be transferred to them. We take steps to ensure such transfers are subject to appropriate safeguards where required by law.

## 11. Changes to This Notice

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We will post the updated notice and, for material changes, we will notify you (e.g., by email or in-product notice) as required by law. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated notice.
