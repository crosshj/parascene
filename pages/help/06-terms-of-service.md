## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using parascene ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. We may update these terms from time to time; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 2. Description of Service

parascene is a community platform for creating, sharing, and discovering content made with AI and generative tools. The Service includes creation tools, feeds, profiles, comments, notifications, credits, and optional integration with third-party servers and providers. We may add, change, or discontinue features with reasonable notice where practicable.

## 3. Accounts and Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account. You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date. One account per person; do not share accounts or create multiple accounts to circumvent limits or policies.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in line with these terms and our policies. You will not:

- Upload, create, or share content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, infringing, or that violates others' privacy or rights.
- Use the Service to spam, phish, or distribute malware, or to scrape or automate access in ways we do not permit.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or our systems.
- Circumvent or abuse credits, rate limits, or other technical or policy restrictions.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or that we reasonably believe pose a risk to the Service or others.

## 5. Your Content and Licenses

You retain ownership of content you create or upload ("Your Content"). By submitting Your Content to the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, display, and use it as needed to operate and improve the Service (e.g., thumbnails, feeds, backups). We do not claim ownership of Your Content beyond this license.

You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to submit Your Content and that it does not infringe third-party rights. We may remove content that we believe violates these terms or the law, or in response to valid legal process.

## 6. Credits and Payments

parascene may use a credits system for creation, boosting, or other actions. Credits may be earned (e.g., daily claims, participation) or obtained through other means we make available. Use of credits is subject to the rules we describe in the product and on the [Pricing](/pricing) page. Any paid options or tipping are voluntary and may be subject to additional payment terms as stated at the time of purchase.

### Refunds

Earned credits (e.g., from daily claims or participation) are non-refundable and have no cash value. For any purchase of credits, top-ups, or other paid options we may offer: refunds are handled in line with the payment terms shown at checkout and applicable law. If you believe a charge was made in error or you are entitled to a refund under those terms, contact us (e.g., via [Help](/help) or Contact in the app) with your account details and the transaction information so we can review. We will process valid refund requests in accordance with our policy and legal obligations.

## 7. Third-Party Servers and Providers

You may connect to or use third-party servers or providers (e.g., for generation). Those services are governed by their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for their availability, conduct, or content. Your use of them is at your own risk.

## 8. Privacy

Our use of your data is described in our [Privacy Notice](/help/privacy). By using the Service you consent to that processing. We use data to provide, secure, and improve the Service and to comply with law.

## 9. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these terms, for operational or legal reasons, or at our discretion. On termination, your right to use the Service ends. We may retain and use data as described in our Privacy Notice and as required by law.

## 10. Disclaimers

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that content or results will meet your expectations.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, parascene and its affiliates, officers, and employees shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the Service. Our total liability for any claims arising from the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim (or one hundred dollars if you paid nothing).

## 12. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms of Service. We will post the updated terms and, where appropriate, notify you (e.g., by email or in-product notice). Material changes may allow you to reject the new terms by discontinuing use before the effective date; otherwise, continued use constitutes acceptance.

## 13. General

These terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws. Any dispute shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce a right does not waive that right.
